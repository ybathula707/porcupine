# my-agent-directory

An Inkeep Agent Framework project with multi-service architecture.

## Architecture

This project follows a workspace structure with the following services:

- **Agents Manage API** (Port 3002): Agent configuration and managemen
  - Handles entity management and configuration endpoints.
- **Agents Run API** (Port 3003): Agent execution and chat processing  
  - Handles agent communication. You can interact with your agents either over MCP from an MCP client or through our React UI components library
- **Agents Manage UI** (Port 3000): Web interface available via `inkeep dev`
  - The agent framework visual builder. From the builder you can create, manage and visualize all your graphs.

## Quick Start
1. **Install the Inkeep CLI:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install -g @inkeep/agents-cli
   ```

1. **Start services:**
   ```bash
   # Start Agents Manage API and Agents Run API
   pnpm dev
   
   # Start the Dashboard
   inkeep dev
   ```

3. **Deploy your first agent graph:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to your project's graph directory
   cd src/default/
   
   # Push the weather graph to create it
   inkeep push weather.graph.ts
   ```
  - Follow the prompts to create the project and graph
  - Click on the "View graph in UI:" link to see the graph in the management dashboard

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are defined in the following places:

- `apps/manage-api/.env`: Agents Manage API environment variables
- `apps/run-api/.env`: Agents Run API environment variables
- `src/default/.env`: Inkeep CLI environment variables
- `.env`: Root environment variables 

To change the API keys used by your agents modify `apps/run-api/.env`. You are required to define at least one LLM provider key.

```bash
# AI Provider Keys
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key-here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
```



### Agent Configuration

Your graphs are defined in `src/default/weather.graph.ts`. The default setup includes:

- **Weather Graph**: A graph that can forecast the weather in a given location.

Your inkeep configuration is defined in `src/default/inkeep.config.ts`. The inkeep configuration is used to configure defaults for the inkeep CLI. The configuration includes:

- `tenantId`: The tenant ID
- `projectId`: The project ID
- `agentsManageApiUrl`: The Manage API URL
- `agentsRunApiUrl`: The Run API URL


## Development

### Updating Your Agents

1. Edit `src/default/weather.graph.ts`
2. Push the graph to the platform to update: `inkeep pus weather.graph.ts` 

### API Documentation

Once services are running, view the OpenAPI documentation:

- Manage API: http://localhost:3002/docs
- Run API: http://localhost:3003/docs

## Learn More

- [Inkeep Documentation](https://docs.inkeep.com)

## Troubleshooting

## Inkeep CLI commands

- Ensure you are runnning commands from `cd src/default`.
- Validate the `inkeep.config.ts` file has the correct api urls.
- Validate that the `.env` file in `src/default` has the correct `DB_FILE_NAME`.

### Services won't start

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pnpm install`
2. Check that ports 3000-3003 are available

### Agents won't respond

1. Ensure that the Agents Run API is running and includes a valid Anthropic or OpenAI API key in its .env file
